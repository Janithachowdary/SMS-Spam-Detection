# SMS-Spam-Detection
The objective of this program is to develop a model for SMS spam 
filtering based on character n-gram models. The model aims to 
classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam based on the 
character n-gram features of the messages. The character n-gram 
model is a powerful technique that can capture the sequence of 
characters in SMS messages, and thus it can be used to identify 
patterns and features that distinguish spam messages from 
legitimate messages. By using this approach, we can develop an 
accurate and effective SMS spam filter that can help mobile phone 
users to avoid spam messages and enhance their overall user 
experience
